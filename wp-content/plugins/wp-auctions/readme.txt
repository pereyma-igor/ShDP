== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The plugin isn't working well on my blog. What could the problem be? =

The plugin uses the jQuery Javascript library and was coded with best practices to not conflict with your theme or other plugins. To check where the problem could be, try to switch to the default theme and disable your other plugins and see if that will fix the problem.

= Why does the AJAX popup look weird on my blog? =

This could be due to the CSS of your theme. While we try to override reset settings for the popup CSS there are some instances where themes have been known to override our CSS settings. Yes, it's a vicious cycle. To fix this issue, try and edit the CSS of the theme if you are comfortable doing so or ask your theme designer for help.

= What features are available in the Pro version? =
